Fees for payday loans already are hefty. Lenders usually charge a percentage or certain dollar amount for every $100 borrowed. Depending on state law, this fee could be between $10 and $30 for every $100 borrowed. That equates to an annual percentage rate of nearly 400% for a two-week loan.

If you're unable to repay the loan on the original due date, your lender may roll it over if you pay the original amount of fees due. For example, if you borrow $400 and pay $15 for every $100 borrowed, the initial fees due would be $60. If you need more time to repay the loan, the lender may charge you $60 and extend the due date for two weeks. At that time, you would have to pay the $400 plus another $60 in fees.
